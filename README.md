As a systems analyst, I often need to quickly confirm and/or assess the effects of various Essbase data operations I perform, such as loading and calculating new data, or moving existing data between different scenarios and versions. To facilitate that, I created a process that uses Excel VBA to capture "Before" and "After" snapshots of data for each of the Essbase cubes in the FP&A department. The "After" sheets are then analyzed by a second VBA process that compares their values with the corresponding "Before" values and marks all variant cells with a yellow background. The VBA also compiles a list of columns containing at least one yellow cell, and writes that list to the upper left corner of each "After" sheet. This gives me a quick and very powerful visual assessment of which cubes changed, exactly where they changed, and to what degree.
